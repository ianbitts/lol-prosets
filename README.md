# Lol Prosets - API Challenge 2.0 Submission
by Ian Bitts and Stanley Lim

The item sets utility in League of Legends gives players a way to plan out their builds before entering the game.
This can be great for making new, fun, experimental builds. However, players looking to improve their ranking in 
the game will find it useful to create item sets based on the play styles of the best of the best- the league of legends
professionals.

Lol Prosets aims to help players find the best item builds for champions by looking at the ranked history of some of League's
best players. Users of the application can search for a summoner, or simply select a Challenger level player at random, and
then browse their match history to see which items they purchase for champions, and when.

Lol Prosets also offers a minimized interface for creating item sets from scratch. Using the app, players can create a set to
the same level of detail that is offered by the in game tool. Once a player has perfected their set, they can download the set
as a zipped JSON file, and merge the file into their League of Legends config directory in order to use the set in game.
